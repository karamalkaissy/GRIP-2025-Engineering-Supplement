Hello!

My name is Karam Alkaissy and this is my GitHub link for engineering in regards to GRIP 2025: Sustainable Development in Ho Chi Minh City.

I have included two items:

1. Preliminary Design Report: Direct Methanol Fuel Cell
   
   In my application, I mentioned how I worked on assembling an ethanol fuel cell last semester for one of my classes. This semester, I am taking it a step further and assemble a methanol fuel cell in a team of three. This is an ongoing project and I have included our preliminary design report to illustrate my interests in renewable energy.

2. Python Script: Solving Energy Balances in Thermodynamics

As part of my final project last semester for my scientific computing class, I wrote a Python script with valuable applications in thermodynamics. This script is an interactive tool for solving energy balance problems. It prompts the user to specify whether their system is open or closed, then collects relevant input data such as changes in potential energy (PE), kinetic energy (KE), enthalpy (H or U), heat transfer (Q), and work (W). Based on user input, it calculates the missing variable using an energy balance equation.
