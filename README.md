Hello!

My name is Karam Alkaissy and this is my GitHub link for engineering in regards to GRIP 2025: Sustainable Development in Ho Chi Minh City :)

I have included two items:

1. Preliminary Design Report: Direct Methanol Fuel Cell.
   In my application, I mentioned how I worked on assembling an ethanol fuel cell last semester for one of my classes. This semester, I am taking it a step further and assemble a methanol fuel cell in a team of three. This is an ongoing project and I have included our preliminary design report to illustrate my interests in renewable energy.
